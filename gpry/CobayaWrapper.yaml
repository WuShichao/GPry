# Options regarding the bayesian optimization loop.
# NB: 'd' after a number means the dimensionality of the sampling space,
#     and a number following 'd' means the power of the dimensionality factor.

# General options for the main loop
options:
  # Number of finite initial truth evaluations before starting the learning loop
  n_initial: 3d
  # Maximum number of truth evaluations at initialization. If it is reached before
  # `n_initial` finite points have been found, the run will fail. To avoid that, try
  # decreasing the volume of your prior
  max_initial: 30d1.5
  # Maximum number of truth evaluations before the run stops. This is useful for e.g.
  # restricting the maximum computation resources.
  max_total: 70d1.5
  # Maximum number of sampling points accepted into the GP training set before the run
  # stops. If this limit is frequently saturated, try decreasing the prior volume.
  max_finite:  # default (undefined) = max_total
  # Number of points which are aquired with Kriging believer for every acquisition step.
  # Gets adjusted (with 20% tol.) to match a multiple of the num. of parallel processes.
  n_points_per_acq: d
  # Number of iterations between full GP hyperparameters fits, including several
  # restarts of the optimiser. Pass 'np.inf' or a large number to never refit with restarts.
  fit_full_every: 2d0.5
  # Similar to `fit_full_every`, but with a single optimiser run from the last optimum.
  # Overridden by `fit_full_every` if it applies. Pass np.inf or a large number to never
  # refit from last optimum (hyperparameters kept constant in that iteration).
  fit_simple_every: 1  # every iteration

  # Factor used to clip the GPR from above, to avoid overshoots (undefined to disable)
  clip_factor: 1.1
  # Treatment of infinities and large negative values; False for no classifier

  # Difference in standard deviations ('s') for considering a value as -infinity
