Initialisation
==============

This document describes the general initialisation options, the initial proposer and its settings.

Among other topics:
- how many points? max budget
- tip: not too many, especially not too many too close to each other and the centre of the mode: makes it very tense (especially RBF, maybe matern5/2 not so much)
- describe main proposers: uniform, ref, covmat, mixes...
